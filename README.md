Summary of outcome
The aim of this project was to build one series and one parallell circuit, and then use physical measurements taken by a Digital Multimeter to verify theoretical values calculated by using Thevenin's and Norton's theorems. This had was also related to verifying the accuracy of Kirchoffs voltage and current laws, which are the basis for calculating Thevinin and Norton equivalent circuits. This also served as additional practice for measuring resistance, voltage and current through circuit elements using the DMM. 
# Methods/Tests:
step 1) the resistances of each of the resistors was verified using the DMM, before use in the circuits to ensure correct functionality.
the results of the measurements are tabulated with respect to the expected values below:
(TABLE FROM EXCEL)
Step 2) A series circuit was soldered to the prototyping solder board. The circuit was composed of a 1 KiloOhm resistor, a 2.2 KiloOhm resistor and a 5.1 KiloOhm resistor, which were all connected to a DCPS set to supply 10 Volts. Below is an image of the circuit after soldering.

Step 3) The voltage drop across each of the resistors were measured using the DMM and Tabulated, shown in the results section. Included in this is also a reading of the current in the circuit, obtained by putting the DMM in series with any part of the circuit.
Step 4) A circuit was built on a breadboard with a 4.7 KiloOhm resistor in series with a paralell combination containing 3 branches. the first branch with a series combination of resistors measuring 6.8 KiloOhms and 15 KiloOhms respectively. the second branch with a 220 KiloOhm resistor and the third branch with a 2.2 KiloOhm resistor. The DCPS was used as the voltage source and set to deliver 12 Volts. This was verified using the DMM.
Step 5) the currents and Voltages through each of the resistors were measured using the DMM and tabulated below.
Step 6) To simulate the Norton resistance the 2.2KIloOhm resistance was removed, and the leads of the DCPS were disconeccted and replaced with a short circuit to connect all the components. Using the DMM the Norton resistance was measured.

# Results:
For Circuit 1 each of the voltages are tabulated below, and compared to an expected values (calculated using Ohms law).

For the Second circuit the currents and voltage drops for each of the circuit component were the following:

# Discussion:
Discussion Question 1: Are the measured Currents in agreement with Kirchoffs Current law?
Yes, we observed that 
Discussion Question 2: Compare the measured Voltages and the calculated Values. Are these in agreement with Kirchoffs voltage law?
Discussion Question 3: Calculate the power delivered by the power supply and the power dissipated by every resistor. Is the power delivered by the power supply equal to the total power dissipated?
Discussion Question 4: Using circuit analysis, calculate RTH, IN, and VTH, and compare them with the measured values. Are the calculated values in agreement with the measured values?
# Conclusion:
Most important things derived/learned from the lab and report (one or two paragraphs).
