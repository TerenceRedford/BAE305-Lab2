step 1) the resistances of each of the resistors was verified using the DMM, before use in the circuits to ensure correct functionality.
the results of the measurements are tabulated with respect to the expected values below:
(TABLE FROM EXCEL)
Step 2) A series circuit was soldered to the prototyping solder board. The circuit was composed of a 1 KiloOhm resistor, a 2.2 KiloOhm resistor and a 5.1 KiloOhm resistor, which were all connected to a DCPS set to supply 10 Volts. Below is an image of the circuit after soldering.

Step 3) The voltage drop across each of the resistors were measured using the DMM and Tabulated, shown in the table below. Included in this is also a reading of the current in the circuit, also obtained using the DMM.
Step 4) A circuit with a 4.7 KiloOhm resistor in series with a paralell combination containing 3 branches. the first branch with a series combination of resistors measuring 6.8 KiloOhms and 15 KiloOhms respectively. the second branch with a 220 KiloOhm resistor and the third branch with a 2.2 KiloOhm resistor. The DCPS was used as the voltage source and set to deliver 12 Volts. This was verified using the DMM.
Step 5) the currents and Voltages through each of the resistors were measured using the DMM and tabulated below.
